# Dynamic Programming

Dynamic Programming is an approach to caching, searching, and more algorithms 
through the principle of recursion (breaking one process into identical 
subprocesses, as in fibonacci or related sequences).

## Background

I didn't feel that I spent enough time within my Data Structures, Algorithms, and
Advanced Math courses in college focusing on Dynamic Programming and Recursion: 
(these were covered, but I wasn't ready to tackle the issue thoroughly yet).

## Contributing

Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first
to discuss what you would like to change and to explain your process. 

Well documented comments are essential.
